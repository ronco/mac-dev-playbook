# blimmer's Mac Development Ansible Playbook

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/blimmer/mac-dev-playbook.svg?branch=blimmer-master)](https://travis-ci.org/blimmer/mac-dev-playbook)

This is a fork of [geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook), customized for my needs.

## Installation

  1. Ensure Apple's command line tools are installed (`xcode-select --install` to launch the installer).
  2. [Install Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html).
  3. Clone this repository to your local drive.
  4. Run `$ ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml` inside this directory to install required Ansible roles.
  5. Run `ansible-playbook main.yml -i inventory -K` inside this directory. Enter your account password when prompted.

> Note: If some Homebrew commands fail, you might need to agree to Xcode's license or fix some other Brew issue. Run `brew doctor` to see if this is the case.

## Testing the Playbook

Many people have asked me if I often wipe my entire workstation and start from scratch just to test changes to the playbook. Nope! Instead, I posted instructions for how I build a [Mac OS X VirtualBox VM](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-osx-virtualbox-vm), on which I can continually run and re-run this playbook to test changes and make sure things work correctly.

Additionally, this project is [continuously tested on Travis CI's macOS infrastructure](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook).
